systemd-shim (10-3~exp2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * QA upload.

  [ Ian Jackson ]
  * Wrapper script moved to libexec, as it contains an arch-specific path
    and is therefore itself arch-specific.  Closes:#851566.
  * Fix my email address in changelog entry for 10-3~exp1.

  [ Nikolaus Schulz ]
  * Support hybrid-sleep.  Closes:#780697.

systemd-shim (10-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release:
    - Use the ntp support for 'systemd-timesyncd.service' too.
    - Don't override an existing release agent.
  * autopkgtests: The tests won't work when running under systemd; in that
    case, try to install upstart and reboot, and skip if that's not available.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8 (no changes necessary).
  * debian/control: Drop obsolete XS-Testsuite: tag.
  * debian/tests/control: Modernize syntax.
  * debian/tests/*: Install sysvinit-core instead of upstart, as the latter is
    gone from Debian, and upstart-sysv is gone from Ubuntu.
  * debian/watch: Adjust for new upstream location, directly using github
    tarballs.

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * autopkgtests: umount /sys/power/state instead of the source

systemd-shim (9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Add org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager Version property (Closes: #766237)
    - Clean up closing logind sessions (Closes: #756076)
  * Add myself to Uploaders: with Steve's consent.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes necessary).

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 05 Nov 2014 21:55:33 +0100

systemd-shim (8-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop the dbus policy entirely from this package, as discussed in bug
    #765101; since the security policy should always be in sync with
    systemd's, and since the systemd package ships both logind (the consumer
    of systemd-shim) and this dbus policy, there's no reason to ship this
    separately rather than relying on the systemd copy.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Oct 2014 04:29:44 +0000

systemd-shim (8-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/patches/dbus-policy-v215.patch: update our dbus policy to match
    that from systemd 215.  Closes: #765101.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Oct 2014 04:54:09 +0000

systemd-shim (8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * No-change rebuild against systemd 215.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Sep 2014 07:02:23 +0200

systemd-shim (8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update watch file.
  * New upstream release.
    - Drop patches cherry-picked from upstream.
  * Add versioned dependency on cgmanager (>= 0.32) for new APIs.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Sep 2014 15:51:34 +0000

systemd-shim (7-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/patches/0001-cgmanager-stop-doing-async-calls.patch:
    cgmanager: stop doing async calls; fixes a race condition on login.
    Thanks to Ryan Lortie <desrt@desrt.ca>.  Closes LP: #1365095.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri, 05 Sep 2014 15:49:39 -0700

systemd-shim (7-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix Start TransientUnit signature for systemd >= 209. Check systemd
    version during package build. Patch from upstream git. (LP: #1351815)
  * Add systemd build dep for above configure check to work.
  * Generate Breaks: to systemd >= or << 209, depending on which version we
    build against.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 03 Sep 2014 08:07:00 +0200

systemd-shim (7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Provide cgmanager integration to work with logind >= 205.
    - Use "shutdown -h" instead of "poweroff" to respect /etc/default/halt
      (LP: #1193944)
    - Add stubs for Subscribe and Unsubscribe (LP: #1348039)
  * Drop all patches, included upstream.
  * debian/tests/lifecycle: Stop assuming that the shim isn't running
    initially, as it's now often activated during login, upgrade, etc.
    Instead, kill it manually to re-test D-BUS activation. Fixes autopkgtest
    regression.
  * debian/tests/power: Adjust to poweroff → shutdown upstream change.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Aug 2014 08:22:08 +0200

systemd-shim (6-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Mark systemd-shim as Linux-only, since it now requires cgmanager which
    is also Linux-only.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Aug 2014 22:30:43 -0700

systemd-shim (6-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Merge cgmanager support from Ubuntu; thanks to Serge Hallyn and
    Martin Pitt.  Closes: #752939.
  * Fix wrong path used in the .maintscript file.  Closes: #748791.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jul 2014 16:48:09 +0000

systemd-shim (6-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Mark autopkgtest with "isolation-machine" as this test can't run in
    schroot or LXC.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Sync /etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.systemd-shim.conf with
    /etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.systemd1.conf; since this only
    governs the security policy there's no reason for it to be different
    between the two implementations even though some of the declared
    interfaces will not be available on systemd-shim.  Closes: #746242.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Apr 2014 07:49:10 +0000

systemd-shim (6-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add diversions for the systemd package, and move the systemd-shim dbus
    file to a different filename under /etc/dbus-1 so that we can drop the
    Conflicts with systemd.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed, 01 Jan 2014 10:11:19 +0000

systemd-shim (6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial upload to Debian.

systemd-shim (6-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Flush the right bus (system, not session), to address another case of
      "PrepareForSleep signal is missing" which breaks networking after
      resuming. (LP: #1252121)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 10 Dec 2013 10:54:18 +0100

systemd-shim (5-0ubuntu2) trusty; urgency=low

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5, no changes necessary.
  * Add autopkgtests for lifecycle management and power unit API handling.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 20 Nov 2013 15:06:23 +0100

systemd-shim (5-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Write a sendsigs.omit.d file to prevent upstart from killing us during
      shutdown. That's the other half of preventing suspends during shutdown.
      (LP: #1211514)
  * Update debian/copyright and debian/watch for new upstream address.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 14 Nov 2013 18:44:47 +0100

systemd-shim (4-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Flush bus before exiting on idle to avoid a race where a message is
      queued up but not yet sent. (LP: #1184262, part 1)
    - Adjust the definition of "inactivity" to be 10 seconds after done
      processing the last request instead of 10 seconds after we started.
      This matters for long-running tasks like suspend. (LP: #1184262, part 2)
    - Don't exit-on-idle while shutting down to avoid losing the flag that
      tells us we are in the middle of a shutdown. (Necessary, but not
      sufficient for LP #1211514)
